<div class="chatter">These 75 high-poverty schools across Minnesota had proficiency rates in the 2017 Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments for <span class="math legendary" data="mathScores">math</span>, <span class="reading legendary" data="readingScores">reading</span> or <span class="both legendary" data="bothScores">both</span> that exceeded what would be expected based on their level of poverty, according to a Star Tribune analysis.

<div class="chatter"><h3>About this analysis</h3> The Star Tribune used a linear regression analysis to compare each school’s proficiency rate to an expected proficiency rate based on the school’s percentage of students on free or reduced-price lunch (a common proxy for estimating a school’s poverty rate).</div>

<div class="chatter">Only schools that tested at least 25 students, across all grades, were included in the analysis; alternative learning and special education schools were not included. Schools were identified as “falling short” if the actual proficiency rate was 10 percentage points or more lower than the expected rate. Schools were classified as “better than expected” if their rate was 10 percentage points or more greater than the expected rate. All schools between those marks were categorized “as expected.”</div>

<div class="chatter">High poverty is defined as 50 percent or more of students on free- or reduced-price lunch.</div>
