The rate at which Minneapolis police use force on suspects has dropped by about 50 percent since 2008, according to recently-released data from the City of Minneapolis. 

Measuring the rate of incidents per 10,000 police calls where an officer used bodily force tasers, mace, firearms or other forms of physical resistance shows those actions becoming rarer over the past decade.'

The data also provides a snapshot of what police use-of-force typically looks like in Minnepolis: about 70 percent involved police using bodily force like headlocks on a suspect, more than half of incidents didn't involve a 911 call and two-thirds of suspects were black. Suspects tended to be approached by police most often for suspicious behavior and often attempted to resist by tensing or fleeing.

Neighborhoods in Downtown and the North Side had the most police use-of-force incidents.
