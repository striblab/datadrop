<p>With June in the books, we're guessing a centerpiece of your holiday weekend conversations will be whether or not we're on track to replicate the glorious summer of 2015.</p>
<p>The answer: probably not, but it might be close, according to the first batch of data from the Minnesota state climatology office&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/journal/150715_summer_glory_index.html">Summer Glory Index</a>.</p>
<p>Several spurts of sweltering temperatures, muggy evenings and heavy rain kept last month from replicating the near-perfect weather of June 2015.</p>
<p>In one month alone, we&rsquo;ve already had four days at or above 90 degrees this year in the Twin Cities. That&rsquo;s the same number we had over the entire summer last year.</p>

<p>This perennial Minnesota debate is a little less subjective thanks to the state climatologists.</p>
<p>Last year, they wanted to know if June &mdash; with its abundance of sunny days and pleasant temperatures &mdash; was truly unusual. So they thought it would be amusing to quantify and rank summer weather by pleasantness.</p>
<p>The Summer Glory Index examines average high and low temperatures, humidity (dew point) and precipitation. It then uses these four categories to score each day&rsquo;s outdoor comfort. Each category accounts for 10 points of the day&rsquo;s overall score, with the most &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; days earning a perfect 40.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It essentially helps us score the extent to which our days were comfortable, our nights were sleep-able&hellip;and if we weren&rsquo;t drenched by our own sweat,&rdquo; said Kenny Blumenfeld, senior climatologist with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.</p>

<p>By the index&rsquo;s standards, an ideal summer day boasts a high temperature in the 70s, a low in the upper 50s or low 60s, a dew point of less than 60 and no rain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a &ldquo;fail point&rdquo; for rotten days. For temperature, a day is considered a &ldquo;fail&rdquo; if the high temperature exceeds 90 degrees or remains below 60 degrees. Points are deducted if a day reaches those limits.</p>
<p>According to the SGI index, June 2015&rsquo;s gloriousness helped make summer 2015 the third best summer on record.</p>
<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s SGI scores go back to 1903, but the data only accounts for conditions in the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>Historically, Minnesotans enjoyed the most &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; summer in 1922, followed by a second-best summer in 2008.</p>
<p>The scorching heat of 1936 secured its ignominious position as the worst summer on record, while humidity sealed the fate of the summer of 1983, ranked second-worst. <br />
<br />
Good &mdash; and awful &mdash; summers tend to come in multi-year groups, and Minnesota is the middle of a comfortable stretch, Blumenfeld said. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And what can we expect in&nbsp;July and August? Can the historical Summer Glory Index data give any hints of what's ahead?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;" class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a scientifically knowable question,&rdquo; Blumenfeld said. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;" class="MsoNormal">Some glorious Junes have been followed by dreadful weather in July and August. Similarly, miserable weather in June doesn&rsquo;t necessarily precipitate a terrible summer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;" class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like tracking baseball stats,&rdquo; Blumenfeld said. &ldquo;You have no idea.&rdquo;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
