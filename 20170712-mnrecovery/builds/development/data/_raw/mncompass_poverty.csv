"In 2015, the federal poverty threshold for a household of two adults and"
"two children was about $$23,991."

"SAIPE uses statistical models to create its estimates. The models relate"
"state and county estimates of income and poverty from the American"
"Community Survey (ACS) to other indicators of income and poverty including"
"federal income tax returns, SNAP benefits data (formerly known as Food"
"Stamp Program data), the most recent decennial census, intercensal"
"population estimates, Supplemental Security Income recipiency, and economic"
"data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. These estimates are then"
"combined with direct estimates from the ACS sample to provide figures which"
"are more precise than either set alone. This is a standard method for"
"making statistical estimates for small areas."
