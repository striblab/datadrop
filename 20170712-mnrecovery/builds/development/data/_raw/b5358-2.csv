"Notes:"
"The median is the midpoint value that divides the incomes for all"
"households into two equal halves. "
""
"Median household income by county has been aggregated to the regional level"
"by MNCompass staff by weighting income values by the households in each"
"county within a region. The 2010 household counts by county (from the"
"Decennial Census) were used to weight the 2006-2015 median income data. "
""
"SAIPE uses statistical models to create its estimates. The models relate"
"state and county estimates of income and poverty from the American"
"Community Survey (ACS) to other indicators of income and poverty, including"
"federal income tax returns, SNAP benefits data (formerly known as Food"
"Stamp Program data), the most recent decennial census, intercensal"
"population estimates, Supplemental Security Income recipiency, and economic"
"data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. These estimates are then"
"combined with direct estimates from the ACS sample to provide figures which"
"are more precise than either set alone. This is a standard method for"
"making statistical estimates for small areas."
