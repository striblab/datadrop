# Data Drop - Data-driven interactives, visuals, reporting and analysis for the Star Tribune.

2016-Present

These are dataviz projects built for the Star Tribune's weekly Data Drop feature.

Public data is often included within the appropriately marked folders. Shapefiles and JSON maps are also usually available.

Each project folder houses a different web element. The index.html or index.php files should just load the visualization.

Most elements use Mike Bostock's [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3), [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/), [C3](https://github.com/masayuki0812/c3), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [DataTables](https://www.datatables.net/), [Mapbox JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.2.2/), [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) or some synthesis of those libraries.
