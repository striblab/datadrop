Turf.js Templates

Go to https://www.mapbox.com/guides/intro-to-turf/ for full documentation.

Contained in this repo are the most common Turf.js implementations used by the Star Tribune. Each one can be launched as-is from their respective .html files and have their styles, functionality and data sources bent to your will.

You'll also probably need your own Mapbox.js access token, which you can get by creating a free acccount with Mapbox.
