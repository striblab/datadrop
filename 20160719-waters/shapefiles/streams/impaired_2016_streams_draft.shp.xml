Streams declared impaired prior to 2014 are also included in this dataset unless they have been delisted. The waterbodies included in the dataset will be reported to EPA in 2016 as part of the impaired waters list. EPA evaluates the list and either approves it as-is or modifies it, which may result in changes to this spatial data.

These streams are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). In cases where the NHD does not include a stream reach that MPCA has assessed, a feature is added by MPCA. Since the impaired streams are a small subset of the NHD, only that subset is included in the dataset.  This dataset includes impaired streams which have not yet had a TMDL plan approved by the US EPA, those that have a US EPA approved TMDL plan as well as those waters that do not need a TMDL plan.</abstract><purpose>These data are intended to be used for planning, informational, and cartographic purposes related to surface water quality in Minnesota.</purpose><supplinf>State of Minnesota</supplinf></descript><crossref><citeinfo><title>Detailed information regarding the impaired waterbodies is available in spreadsheet form here: http://www.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/view-document.html?gid=20205</title></citeinfo></crossref><timeperd><current>These data reflect the state of the MPCA's surface water assessment database as of the dataset publication date.</current><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20160706</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo></timeperd><status><progress>Planned</progress><update>As needed</update></status><keywords><theme><themekt>ISO 19115</themekt><themekey>inlandWaters, surface water, water chemistry, water quality</themekey></theme><place><placekey>Minnesota</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><spdom><bounding><westbc>189777.15</westbc><eastbc>727255.82</eastbc><northbc>5436176.49</northbc><southbc>4816310.34</southbc></bounding></spdom><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>Minnesota Pollution Control Agency</cntorg><cntper>Kristofor Parson</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Info Tech Spec III</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>Mailing and Physical</addrtype><address>525 S.

AUID:  Assessment Unit ID, a waterbody identifer that is the WBD eight digit watershed code and the three digit reach number. This AUID constitutes a unique identifer for each reach in the dataset.

CAT: EPA Consolidation Assessment and Listing Methodology [CALM] category, which integrates the 305(b) Report with the 303(d) TMDL List. 
   The five categories in CALM are as follows: 
   Category 1: all designated uses are meeting water quality standards 
   Category 2: some uses are meeting water quality standards and there are insufficient data to assess other uses 
   Category 3: there are insufficient data to assess any uses 
   Category 4: at least one use is impaired, but a TMDL is not required 
   Category 5: at least one use is impaired and a TMDL is required. These become the List of impaired waters. 

A reach can only be placed into one Category. For example, if a reach is impaired for one pollutant but the other uses are being  met, and a TMDL is required, that reach would be placed into Category 5. Furthermore, if the reach is impaired for more than one pollutant, the reach must stay in Category 5 until ALL pollutants have EPA-approved TMDL plans. 

For 'bookkeeping' purposes, these Categories can be sub-divided. Category 4 has the following four sub-categories: 
   4A: Impaired, but a TMDL study has been approved by EPA 
   4B: Impaired, but a TMDL study is not required because water quality standards are expected to be met in the near future 
   4C: Impaired, but a TMDL study is not required because the impairment is not caused by a pollutant 
   4D: An assessment unit is impaired or threatened but doesn't require a TMDL because the impairment is due to natural conditions with only insignificant anthropogenic influence. To be considered 'insignificant', the elimination of the anthropogenic influence would not lead to the attainment of water quality standards and it would not be included in formal pollution reduction goal-setting  activities. A reach-specific water quality standard based on local natural conditions has yet to be determined. Upon determination,    the assessment unit will be considered non-impaired for the natural conditions and re-categorized to an appropriate category. 
   4E: Impaired or threatened but existing data indicates a TMDL is not required because impairment is solely a result of natural    sources; a final determination of Category 4D will be made in the next assessment cycle pending confirmation from additional information (i.e. water quality or land use). 

Category 5 has the following three sub-categories: 
   5A: Impaired by multiple pollutants and no TMDL study plans are approved by EPA 
   5B: Impaired by multiple pollutants and at least one TMDL study plan is approved by EPA 
   5C: Impaired by one pollutant and no TMDL study plan is approved by EPA

High-resolution NHD is the primary dataset from which these features are drawn. If no feature exists in the NHD, then a feature is digitized and added to NHD as a special feature.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>Statements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps.  These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards.  For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position.  Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols.  In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps.  Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data.  Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale).  Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features.
This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data.  Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data.  In some cases, additional information may be available from the data provider upon request.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><procstep><procdesc>The processes used to create and maintain high-resolution NHD data can be requested from MPCA.
